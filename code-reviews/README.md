These examples reflect how I contribute to projects not just by writing code, but by thoughtfully reviewing and elevating othersâ€™ work to ensure clean, reliable, and efficient software.

Feel free to explore the examples and get a sense of how I contribute to high-quality software development.

## General Feedback
1. Discussion around balancing [code organization](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/21061#pullrequestreview-995442273), co-location vs. reuse, and when to generalize for maintainability and clarity. 
1. Noted [potential concern with using array index as a key in React](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/35600#discussion_r2025136962), but acknowledged it as acceptable in this specific static context.
1. Appreciation for a refactorâ€™s clarity and cleanliness, coupled with expressing a [preference for pure functions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/33428#discussion_r1879294023), while still being open to the current approach.

## Celebrating Great Work
1. Positive reinforcement for [a particularly simple and elegant implementation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/35359#discussion_r2007753194) of a boolean-returning function.
1. Acknowledging impressive overall work and [excitement about nearing a major functional milestone](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/33234#pullrequestreview-2466030779).
1. Positive feedback [highlighting a clean and effective organizational refactor](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build/pull/2454#discussion_r1967710132).

## Suggestions for Possible Improvement
1. Consideration of [extracting repeated UI elements into reusable components](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/21642#discussion_r919198716) to improve maintainability, balanced against the risk of overengineering when duplication is minimal and proximity reduces the cost of updates.
1. Suggestion to simplify function component syntax by combining props into a single destructured parameter for [cleaner and more idiomatic code](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/22942#discussion_r1048693725).
1. Naming and testing practice considerations, including the [distinction between stubs and mocks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/31346#discussion_r1718464002) and choosing terminology that reflects their intended useâ€”particularly when verifying call behavior.
1. Affirmed the correctness of the logic, while suggesting a small optimization to [avoid redundant operations by consolidating related logic into a single place](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/24524#discussion_r1228759458).
1. Identified tight coupling in a componentâ€™s implementation and [suggested using inversion of control by passing in behavior as a callback](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/23010#discussion_r1055805843).
1. Raised concerns about [mixed data types causing potential confusion](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/21267#discussion_r890204405) and recommended using consistent default values for clarity and predictability.
1. Noted that setTimeout is unreliable for controlling flow and [recommended using promises or await for more reliable and deterministic asynchronous handling](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/21136#discussion_r879695692).
1. Pointed out that the function mixes responsibilities by both returning data and updating state. Recommended it [focus on a single responsibility](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/21136#discussion_r879700400), such as returning data only.
1. Noted that [a test is too specific and may be brittle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build/pull/1532#discussion_r1176817650), suggesting it could be made more flexible to better accommodate content changes.
1. Proposed efficiency improvements, including [replacing substring parsing with a direct object-based lookup](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build/pull/1487#discussion_r1126411611) for header levels, and [avoiding unnecessary DOM updates](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build/pull/1487#discussion_r1126427567) by checking if headers are already correctly set before modifying them.

## Required Changes
1. Noted presence of [code that should be changed or clarified to prevent confusion](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/22942#discussion_r1048694209).
1. Identified a [breaking issue where a feature toggle is referenced incorrectly](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/23691#discussion_r1147935086), and recommended using either the correct naming convention or the provided selector to ensure consistency and functionality.
1. Highlighted that implemented [grouping logic uses an incorrect data attribute](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build/pull/1585#discussion_r1213546694), which may cause inaccurate classification, and recommended explicitly defining group membership to avoid false positives.
1. Called out a [mismatch between a functionâ€™s name and its actual behavior](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build/pull/1409#discussion_r1054817005), noting that it contributed to a broader issue with the code not working as intended. 

## Attention to Detail
1. Pointing out an incorrect variable reference causing [an unintended closure](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/33428#discussion_r1879263820) over an outer variable instead of using the intended passed-in parameter.
1. Noticed [a missing closing >](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/35359#discussion_r2007760220) in a type definition.
1. Noticed a [potentially outdated import path](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/24089#discussion_r1184199381) and suggested a more appropriate shared location.
1. Pointed out an [unnecessary call to Object.keys on a variable that is already an array](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/20790#discussion_r853428399).

## Process & Consistency Recommendations
1. Discussion about [ensuring consistency when removing deprecated features](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/22494#issuecomment-1307761540) across multiple code locations, recommending addressing all related instances together or deferring a complete cleanup to a separate dedicated ticket.
1. Noted the current pattern of importing the module where the widget is mounted and [suggested maintaining consistency with that approach unless there is a strong reason to change](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/20790#discussion_r853387734).

## Strategic Architectural Considerations
1. Questions about [avoiding collisions on user-generated keys](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/34882#discussion_r1973838631) and [managing deduplication](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/34882#discussion_r1973845462), along with some [general discussion on solving the problem within the current architecture](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/34882#pullrequestreview-2648234062).
1. Emphasized that handling invalid API responses is likely the application's responsibility, and that embedding this logic in the template [introduces unnecessary complexity in the wrong layer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build/pull/1416#pullrequestreview-1233148208).
1. [Encouraged a significant refactor](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build/pull/1399#pullrequestreview-1218230040) of code that carries considerable technical debt and is highly prone to subtle bugs and unexpected issues.

## Asking Questions for Understanding
1. Questions to [clarify the purpose and role of certain data structures](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/32019#discussion_r1781282525) and how they fit into the overall testing or development workflow, particularly around temporary configuration and testing strategies.
1. Digging into a key change to understand its necessity by comparing it to the previous behavior and [asking about the rationale](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/33428#discussion_r1879291913) behind its introduction.
